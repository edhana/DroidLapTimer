DroidLapTImer

is another LapTimer project made for Android phones. This application is focused on track day addicts who want to improve their lap times by using some basic thelemetry data, like speed and aceleration, turn in points, lean angle ( in case of motorcycles ) and of course, their times. The great buzz about this application it's the intregation with other tools, and the opportunity to paticipace in a community of racers, track day riders, race team, and so on. Some could use it just to manage their times, and others could use this app to interact with the racing communit around the world.

So why this application is open source?

Because I am a motorcycle rider and I like to develop new ways to make this sport always a great experience and I have also to track and improve my skills.
